ðŸ›  Project Overview
This project implements a wearable breath monitoring solution using two complementary sensors:

MPS20N0040D-D Pressure Sensor

Adafruit 519 Conductive Rubber Cord Strain Sensor

Both sensors detect respiratory activity through pressure variation and torso expansion. The STM32 microcontroller captures and processes signals in real-time, and Python scripts handle feature extraction and breath cycle estimation.

Key Features:
Analog signal conditioning with op-amp circuits

Real-time sampling and UART data transfer

Digital signal processing: smoothing, thresholding, and compression

Dual-sensor data fusion for enhanced detection reliability

Accurate breath rate estimation under varied physical conditions

ðŸ”§ Circuit Design
Pressure Sensor Circuit: Differential amplifier with gain â‰ˆ 1000 using R1 = R2 = 1kÎ© and Rf = Rg = 1MÎ©

Rubber Sensor Circuit: Voltage divider with signal shifting and amplification to map output to STM32â€™s ADC range (0.5â€“3V)

ðŸ”„ STM32 Signal Processing
Multiplexed ADC Channels (Channels 8 & 9)

Sampling rate: 650 Hz

Baud rate: 115200

Data compression: Binary thresholding (LOW/HIGH)

Noise filtering: Hysteresis thresholds with software Schmitt trigger

ðŸ§® Python Post-Processing
Moving average filter (N = 300) applied to rubber sensor data

Peak detection using scipy.signal.find_peaks

Z-score normalization and signal phase alignment

Fusion logic compensates for missed peaks via redundancy
